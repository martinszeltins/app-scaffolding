**Known issues**

There seems to be a bug with Vue router 4 where it doesn't render nested components on router.push()


**Change scaffold variables**

Search for all "scaffold" variables and change them to your liking.


**Intellisense**

In order to get intellisense to work, you should also install both client and server dependencies (npm install and composer install)


**Adminer**

You can connect from your host to the mysql container using adminer

````
System: MySQL
Server: 127.0.0.1:37092 (localhost won't work)
Username: root
Password: scaffold_password
````



**Add a TLS certificate**

You can easily add a TLS certificate using ````mkcert````

````
mkcert -install
mkcert yoursite.dev *.yoursite.dev
````

Then add it to docker-compose

volumes:
- ./webserver/etc/nginx/cert:/etc/nginx/cert

and also in nginx virtual host
